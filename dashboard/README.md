# Turbine Dashboard

## How to start

If your directory doesn't contain a *node_modules*-folder yet you need to install all depedencies first.

```bash
npm install
```

Once the downloads are finished start the dashboard by executing:

```bash
npm run start
```

## How to build

```bash
npm run build
```

Once the process finishes your artifacts will be located in the */dist*-folder.
